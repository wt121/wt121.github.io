Here is my first blog post of some of the tips that I have found helpful and I will continually add to them. 
If you would like to submit your own blog post feel free to check out the "Submit a Blog Post" section for more details.

1. I have found it helpful to speak through the nose by focusing sound
production through there.

2. Thinking to myself positively and creating confidence.

3. Take it slow and consciously avoid filler words and only think of the words you will speak in your head, without the filler words. 


## New Method of Speech Therapy: Using Delayed Auditory Feedback


Delayed auditory feedback in reducing stuttering is when the stutterer wears headphones that repeat their voice with a delay and often at a different frequency. This method seems to reduce stuttering in many people. 


After reading about its possible applications for stuttering, I decided to try Delayed Auditory Feedback. I downloaded a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fonate-daf-control-stuttering/id981000993">free DAF app</a> on the app store. It's recommended that you use headhpones with it for the best effect.


I began by testing it out with simple conversation between me and my mom. It felt odd listening to delayed, lower-pitched feeback of my voice, but my mind felt much clearer and I could speak without any difficulties.
