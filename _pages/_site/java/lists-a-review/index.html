<p>We’ve discussed our first set of data structures in Java: Arrays, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayList</code>s, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinkedList</code>s. Using these data structures, we now have different ways to represent lists in our programs. In order to develop a more thorough understanding about how these data structures work “under the hood,” we’ll be coding our own versions of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArrayList</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">LinkedList</code> today.</p>
