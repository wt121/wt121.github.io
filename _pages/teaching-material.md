Hi everyone, here are some of the tips that I have found helpful and I will continually add to them.

1. So far is speaking through the nose by focusing sound
production through there.

2. Thinking to myself positively and creating confidence.

3. Take it slow and consciously avoid filler words and only think of the words you will speak in your head, without the filler words.
