Here is my first blog post of some of the tips that I have found helpful and I will continually add to them. 
If you would like to submit your own blog post feel free to check out the "Submit a Blog Post" section for more details.

1. I have found it helpful to speak through the nose by focusing sound
production through there.

2. Thinking to myself positively and creating confidence.

3. Take it slow and consciously avoid filler words and only think of the words you will speak in your head, without the filler words.
