Hello and Welcome to my project! This website is a place where people who stutter can set up meetings with one others to practice their speech and share their stories through blog posts.

 
The meeting time and the meeting's participants are included in a google doc/spreadsheet.


Instructions for submitting a blog post can be found under the "Submit a Blog Post" section.
